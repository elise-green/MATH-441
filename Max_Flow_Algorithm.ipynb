    "## Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm \n",
    " Is an algorithm to find the max-flow of a network.\n",
    " The ford fulkerson algorithm is an iterative method to find the max flow of a graph that contains a source and a sink and has capacity constraints for every edge on the graph. Like every max-flow problem we have to have flow conservation at each of the nodes except for the source and sink nodes. In my description of the problem and algorithm below I will talk about the source node as `s` and the sink node as `t`. \n",
    "\n",
    " The general idea of the algorithm is of we can find a path from s to t such that the capacity of all the edges along the path are  > 0 then we will push the maximum amount of flow from s to t such that the flow is less than or equal to the capacity for each edge along the path. This is where the idea of a residual network comes in. The residual network is the network that represents the capacities of the graph after we push some flow from s to t. So when we push a flow of f from s to t we will subtract f from the capacity of each of the edges that we pushed and we will add f in the reverse direction to each of the edges. To better understand this I will give a simple example. Image we have a graph with only s and t nodes and we have a capacity of 5 along the edge from s to t, the max-flow we can push will be 5, so the residual graph will the edge from s to t with a value of 0 and the edge from t to s with a value of 5. After we have found the residual network we will repeat the step of finding a path from s to t on the residual network and pushing the maximum amount of flow along the path. We will continue to repeat until we can no longer find a path from s to t and then we know we have reached our maximum flow. "

    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "As we can see both ways of solving the max-flow problem give us equivalent solutions. I also was curious to see if there was much of a difference in the time it took for each algorithm to run so I used the time-it function to track the total time each function ran for and I found that the ford-fulkerson algorithm was a bit quicker as it was 1.17e-05 s for it to run vs the linear programming approach took 0.0033s to run so the lp took approximatly 280 times longer to run which is a fair amount longer. This does make some sense as we know that when we use BFS to find the paths in the ford-fulkerson the total runtime must be $O(V E^2)$ where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. However, LP problems have an exponential bound on running time but do tend to converge much faster than that usually and in some cases where there may be a lot of edges in a graph the LP may be quicker.

This took some tough thinking to implement the algorithms even though I was already familiar with the ford-fulkerson algorithm I found that actually implementing it was difficult but it helped to cement my understanding. I think that it was interesting to explore a problem that can very easily be formatted as a linear programming problem be formatted in a different type of algorithm."

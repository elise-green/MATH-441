Learning Portfolio Cover Letter Math 441

This learning portfolio contains learning artifacts which I have been working on over the semester. Each element of my portfolio explores a different area of mathemtical optimization or how I can state a problem as an optimization problem. My interests lie more in applying concepts and designing algorithms than proving mathematical theorems, so my learning portfolio reflects this by  focusing on implementing solutions to problems which I chose to explore. My process of creating my learning artifacts was I would find ideas either from lectures or from my own research that I would like to explore further. Once I had the idea I would do some reading or watch youtube videos on the topic, I find that watching youtube videos is usually easiest way for me to learn. Once I had some more background information on the topic I would like to explore I would start trying different methods and exploring different solutions. The artifact in this portfolio that I am the most proud of would be the l1 vs l2 regression model as I think it demonstrated some good mathematical concepts and also incorperated some data science techniques to process the dataset that I was working on. The most challeging part for me of creating my learning portfolio was to making sure I properly explained all of the steps I did throughout my work. This is difficult for me as I typically get excited an like to hop right into the problem,  but going back and documenting what I did and why did help me to cement my understanding.
